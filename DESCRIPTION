Description: Provides a nonparametric method for estimating scale-free graphical
    models. To avoid the usual Gaussian assumption, we restrict the graph to be
    a forest and build on the work of forest density estimation. The method is
    motivated from a Bayesian perspective and is equivalent to finding the maximum
    spanning tree of a weighted graph with a log degree penalty. We solve the
    optimization problem via a minorize-maximization procedure with Kruskal's
    algorithm.
